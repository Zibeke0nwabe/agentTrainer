            Exciting news! Soon, you’ll be able to interact with our AI, acting just like a real customer on a call. 
            With text-to-speech technology, our AI will use a natural-sounding voice, providing you with a true-to-life 
            experience. This allows you to practice responding to customer queries, improving your ability to handle real calls.

            Why is this important? Training with this technology helps you develop the skills to manage calls confidently 
            and handle customers effectively. However, mistakes are part of the learning process, and when mistakes happen 
            during real calls, they can affect the customer experience. 
            If errors occur, the customer may feel frustrated, and our company’s image can take a hit. Worse still, when 
            customers are dissatisfied, they may be compensated for the inconvenience, which could cost the company.

            The goal is to minimize mistakes by learning through this AI simulation, helping you grow as an agent and ensure 
            customer satisfaction during live calls. <br><br>
            While voice calling is coming soon, our chat service is available now! Feel free to check it out and start training today.
